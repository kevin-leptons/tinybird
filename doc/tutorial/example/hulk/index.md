Like other long-lived characters, the Hulk's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin, wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation. As the character progressed, other outfits were designed that could stretch to accommodate the transformations back and forth
